# Sales and Profit Analysis of a Superstore: Tableau
 The project conducts a thorough study of a Superstoreâ€™s sales and profit data available in one of the Kaggle datasets. It includes data preparation, EDA, and creating informative visuals to find out things like sales distribution, profit over time, and area-wise sales. Enhanced graphics are prepared in Python, which aims at identification of the most sold products and finding relationships between business measures. The last output is an interactive Tableau report which will allow the data to be sliced and diced for any aspect which would be essential for making critical decisions based on facts.
